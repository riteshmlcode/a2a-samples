# ðŸ•’ TellTimeAgent â€“ Google A2A Protocol Demo

This project demonstrates a minimal implementation of Google's [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](https://github.com/google/A2A) protocol using Python. It features:

- A simple A2A server agent (`TellTimeAgent`) built with Flask
- A client agent that discovers and communicates with it
- Full compliance with the A2A message structure and discovery flow

This is perfect for beginners who want to understand how agents discover each other and exchange messages using A2A.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implements A2A discovery via `/.well-known/agent.json`
- Exposes a `tasks/send` endpoint for receiving tasks
- Replies to queries with the current system time
- Client generates a task and parses the response using A2A conventions

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
a2a_samples/
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tell_time_server.py       # Flask-based A2A server agent
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ time_client.py            # A2A client agent that queries the server
```

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask requests
```

### 2. Start the server

```bash
cd a2a_samples/server
python tell_time_server.py
```

### 3. Run the client

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd a2a_samples/client
python time_client.py
```

### âœ… Output

```
Connected to: TellTimeAgent â€“ Tells the current time when asked.
Agent says: The current time is: 2025-04-16 22:10:45
